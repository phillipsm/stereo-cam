Stereoscopic camera
=====

This is an investigation in how to build an open, affordable, digital stereoscopic camera (a camera with more than one lens).

Find project details [http://mattphillips.info/stereo-cam](here).

## Arduino 

Included is the source to caputre images from four [Adafruit VC0706 cameras](http://www.adafruit.com/product/397), and write those images to an [Adafruit MicroSD breakout board](http://www.adafruit.com/products/254).

Find the arduino code in the Arduio directory.

## Laser cutter templates

You can build a camera body by sandwiching the electronics between three plates. I used a laser cutter and 1/4" clear acrylic, but plywood, or alumunum would be fantastic.

Find the templates in the templates directory.
